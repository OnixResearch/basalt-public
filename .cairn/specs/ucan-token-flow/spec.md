# Ucan Token Flow Specification

## Purpose

Defines the `ucan-token-flow` capability.

## Requirements

### Requirement: UCAN semantics fixture contract
r[ucan_semantics_contract.contract] Basalt MUST define a reviewed fixture contract for the UCAN authorization semantics consumed by Basalt policy enforcement.

#### Scenario: Valid semantics fixture passes
r[ucan_semantics_contract.positive]
- GIVEN a fixture declares policy contract ID, requested resource, requested ability, UCAN capability facts, caveat outcome, proof traversal status, replay status, expected enforcement result, and required non-claims
- WHEN the fixture contract is validated
- THEN validation MUST pass and preserve the expected Basalt reason class.

#### Scenario: Malformed semantics fixture fails closed
r[ucan_semantics_contract.negative]
- GIVEN a fixture omits the requested operation, weakens non-claims, or declares incompatible UCAN and Basalt result fields
- WHEN the fixture contract is validated
- THEN validation MUST fail with deterministic diagnostics.

### Requirement: Runtime adapter fixture replay
r[ucan_semantics_contract.runtime_adapter] Basalt MUST replay exported UCAN semantics fixtures through the Rust enforcement boundary without reimplementing UCAN authorization semantics in Nickel.

#### Scenario: Allow fixture reaches allowed receipt
r[ucan_semantics_contract.runtime_adapter.allow]
- GIVEN a fixture where Basalt policy permits the operation and UCAN capability facts authorize the same concrete operation
- WHEN the Rust fixture replay runs
- THEN Basalt MUST emit an allowed receipt with the expected reason.

#### Scenario: Negative fixture reaches denied receipt
r[ucan_semantics_contract.runtime_adapter.deny]
- GIVEN a fixture with over-delegation, wildcard request misuse, missing caveat policy, stale proof semantics, or replay denial
- WHEN the Rust fixture replay runs
- THEN Basalt MUST emit a denied or error receipt with the expected fail-closed reason.

### Requirement: UCAN dependency boundary
r[ucan_semantics_contract.boundary] Basalt documentation MUST state which UCAN semantic manifest, Git revision, or exported contract identity was validated and which claims remain outside Basalt.

#### Scenario: Dependency identity is visible
r[ucan_semantics_contract.boundary.identity]
- GIVEN a Basalt release or downstream compatibility receipt is produced
- WHEN a reviewer inspects the UCAN dependency section
- THEN the receipt SHOULD name the UCAN semantic manifest digest when available or the pinned UCAN revision when no manifest exists.

#### Scenario: Non-claims are preserved
r[ucan_semantics_contract.boundary.non_claims]
- GIVEN a Basalt enforcement compatibility report passes
- WHEN the supported claim is rendered
- THEN it MUST state that Basalt does not prove key-resolution truth, revocation backend freshness, cryptographic soundness beyond UCAN's boundary, consumer replay-store durability, or application-wide authorization completeness.

### Requirement: Validation evidence
r[ucan_semantics_contract.validation] The change MUST include contract validation, focused Rust fixture replay, and Cairn validation evidence before archive.

#### Scenario: Positive and negative evidence is saved
r[ucan_semantics_contract.validation.fixtures]
- GIVEN the semantics fixture matrix includes positive and negative cases
- WHEN the validation rail runs
- THEN positive fixtures MUST pass, negative fixtures MUST fail closed, and the saved receipt MUST bind fixture and policy identities.

### Requirement: UCAN/Basalt authority core contract
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.contract] Basalt MUST define pure authority core contracts for request identity, contract ID, resource, ability, verified UCAN grant refs, UCAN verification receipt refs, Basalt policy refs, caveat/replay dispositions, deny diagnostics, and bounded non-claims.

#### Scenario: Matching authority input admits request
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.fixtures.positive]
- GIVEN an authority input names a Basalt contract, resource, ability, request ref, verified UCAN grant refs, matching UCAN verification receipt refs, and matching Basalt policy refs
- WHEN the authority core evaluates the input
- THEN the decision MUST allow only the exact bounded request described by the input.

#### Scenario: Invalid authority input denies request
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.fixtures.negative]
- GIVEN an authority input has missing verified grants, wrong resource, wrong ability, stale verification refs, caveat denial, replay denial, missing policy refs, malformed request refs, or authority overclaims
- WHEN the authority core evaluates the input
- THEN the decision MUST deny with deterministic diagnostics naming the failed binding.

### Requirement: UCAN/Basalt authority validation is pure
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.validation] Basalt MUST implement authority decision validation as pure deterministic logic over in-memory request facts, verified UCAN fact refs, policy refs, caveat dispositions, and replay dispositions.

#### Scenario: Shell owns verification inputs
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.validation.shell]
- GIVEN a caller parses tokens, resolves keys, loads policy JSON, reads clocks, or consults revocation/replay backends
- WHEN the authority core evaluates a request
- THEN those side effects MUST remain outside the authority core.

### Requirement: UCAN verification remains external input
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.ucan_boundary] The authority core MUST consume verified UCAN facts and MUST NOT parse compact tokens, verify signatures, resolve DIDs, read clocks, fetch proofs, consult revocation stores, or evaluate replay stores.

#### Scenario: Raw token is insufficient
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.ucan_boundary.raw_token]
- GIVEN a request carries only a raw token or content reference without verified grant refs and UCAN verification receipt refs
- WHEN the authority core evaluates the request
- THEN the decision MUST deny before treating token possession as current authority.

### Requirement: Nickel remains policy review boundary
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.policy_boundary] Basalt SHOULD keep human-authored contract policy in Nickel while the authority core consumes deterministic Rust policy values.

- GIVEN an existing Basalt enforcement request uses current public contract, resource, ability, and capability fields
- WHEN an adapter validates the request
- THEN the adapter SHOULD preserve those fields while routing reusable authority checks through the shared core.

### Requirement: Authority core remains bounded
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.docs] Passing authority-core validation MUST NOT grant transport authority, storage authority, persistence authority, replay-store truth, key-resolution trust, downstream business authority, release eligibility, or whole-system safety.

#### Scenario: Boundary is visible
r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.ucan_basalt_authority_core.final_validation]
- GIVEN an authority-core decision allows a request
- WHEN an operator reads the supported claim

r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.v1_profile.authority] Basalt MUST complete all fallible profile mapping, policy evaluation, authority construction, allocation, and receipt preparation before the composed final replay commit. It MUST NOT call a second replay boundary after UCAN state consumption.

#### Scenario: Basalt policy denies

- GIVEN UCAN preflight facts pass but Basalt mapping or policy denies
- WHEN enforcement runs
- THEN final replay MUST receive zero calls
- AND no live Basalt capability MUST exist

#### Scenario: Replay accepts

- GIVEN UCAN and Basalt preflight facts pass and final replay accepts
- WHEN live authority is constructed
- THEN only infallible moves MUST occur afterward

### Requirement: Final-profile tests cover substitutions

r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.v1_profile.tests] Tests MUST cover valid direct and delegated final Invocations plus unknown mapping, incomplete fact, lossy conversion, caller assertion, source mismatch, profile mismatch, policy denial, and compact/final adapter substitution.

#### Scenario: Cross-profile matrix runs

- GIVEN compact and final credentials, live values, adapters, policies, and source cohorts
- WHEN mismatched combinations are evaluated
- THEN every mismatch MUST fail closed
- AND denied cases MUST create no live authority

### Requirement: Final-profile receipts are redacted evidence

r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.v1_profile.receipt] Final-profile receipts MUST bind the Basalt schema, exact UCAN profile and source cohort, support catalog, mapping, policy, operation, bounded token and request identities, reason, and non-claims with BLAKE3. They MUST omit raw credentials, proofs, arguments, metadata, policies, keys, and private identity text.

#### Scenario: Receipt is persisted

- GIVEN final-profile enforcement succeeds or fails
- WHEN the receipt is serialized
- THEN it MUST contain no bearer or request payload
- AND it MUST provide no path to recreate live authority

### Requirement: Final-profile documentation keeps non-claims

r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.v1_profile.docs] Documentation MUST state that UCAN owns wire and authority verification while Basalt owns application mapping and policy. An allow MUST NOT prove key trust, external resource ownership, revocation freshness, replay durability, transport security, policy completeness, effect execution, or effect correctness.

#### Scenario: Operator reads an allow

- GIVEN final-profile Basalt enforcement allows one exact request
- WHEN the operator reads its supported claim
- THEN the exact cohort and mapping MUST be visible
- AND retained caller boundaries MUST remain explicit

### Requirement: Final-profile adoption passes release checks

r[basalt.ucan_token_flow.v1_profile.validation] The change MUST pass upstream evidence checks, vendored source checks, Nickel freshness, positive and negative adapter tests, receipt tests, formatting, Clippy, release verification, Cairn gates, and the repository Nix check.

#### Scenario: Validation completes

- GIVEN source, evidence, policy, adapters, fixtures, receipts, and documentation are current
- WHEN the validation rail runs
- THEN every required check MUST pass or report one exact bounded blocker

### Requirement: ucan_token_flow.oidc.versioned_policy

r[ucan_token_flow.oidc.versioned_policy]

Basalt SHALL evaluate OIDC exchange under a typed, versioned Nickel policy that names trusted issuers, audiences, algorithms, claim predicates, freshness, network bounds, cache bounds, Mantle capabilities, and UCAN lifetime limits.

#### Scenario: Policy export is valid

- **GIVEN** an accepted OIDC exchange policy
- **WHEN** Basalt exports it for runtime use
- **THEN** the export SHALL be canonical and BLAKE3-identified
- **AND** it SHALL contain no private key, provider credential, OIDC token, or secret value

#### Scenario: Required policy field is absent

- **GIVEN** a policy without an issuer, audience, algorithm, freshness, claim, capability, or network bound required by its profile
- **WHEN** the contract validates it
- **THEN** validation SHALL fail before service startup

### Requirement: ucan_token_flow.oidc.pure_verification

r[ucan_token_flow.oidc.pure_verification]

Basalt SHALL verify OIDC structure, algorithm, key use, signature, issuer, audience, time claims, selected identity claims, and requested capability in a pure core with explicit time and public-key inputs.

#### Scenario: GitHub token satisfies policy

- **GIVEN** a correctly signed token from the configured issuer with the required audience, fresh time claims, accepted repository and workflow claims, and an allowed capability request
- **WHEN** the core verifies it
- **THEN** it SHALL return bounded identity facts and an attenuated issuance plan

#### Scenario: One verification condition fails

- **GIVEN** a malformed token, disallowed algorithm, wrong key use, bad signature, wrong issuer or audience, stale time claim, wrong claim type, claim mismatch, or excessive request
- **WHEN** the core verifies it
- **THEN** it SHALL return a stable typed rejection
- **AND** it SHALL NOT produce an issuance plan

### Requirement: ucan_token_flow.oidc.bounded_jwks

r[ucan_token_flow.oidc.bounded_jwks]

Basalt SHALL retrieve OIDC discovery and JWKS documents only from configured HTTPS origins under named transport, redirect, document, key-count, freshness, and refresh bounds.

#### Scenario: Unknown key rotates safely

- **GIVEN** a token with an unknown `kid` and a configured issuer
- **WHEN** the current key set is still eligible for bounded refresh
- **THEN** the shell MAY fetch one fresh bounded key set
- **AND** the core SHALL verify only a policy-allowed candidate key

#### Scenario: Discovery or key retrieval is unsafe

- **GIVEN** an unapproved redirect, issuer mismatch, TLS failure, timeout, oversized document, malformed document, excessive key set, or stale unavailable cache
- **WHEN** the shell retrieves verification material
- **THEN** exchange SHALL fail closed
- **AND** it SHALL NOT use an ambient or unconfigured key

### Requirement: ucan_token_flow.oidc.attenuated_ucan

r[ucan_token_flow.oidc.attenuated_ucan]

Basalt SHALL issue a UCAN only after successful OIDC verification, and the UCAN audience, operations, project, resource scope, and lifetime SHALL NOT exceed policy or verified OIDC validity.

#### Scenario: Allowed build capability is exchanged

- **GIVEN** verified identity facts and a request for an allowed Mantle build resource
- **WHEN** Basalt issues the UCAN
- **THEN** the token SHALL target the configured Mantle audience
- **AND** it SHALL contain only the granted capability scope
- **AND** it SHALL expire no later than both applicable limits

#### Scenario: Caller requests broader authority

- **GIVEN** a request for an unapproved operation, project, resource, audience, or lifetime
- **WHEN** attenuation evaluates it
- **THEN** exchange SHALL reject or reduce it only as the explicit policy defines
- **AND** it SHALL never silently grant the broader request

### Requirement: ucan_token_flow.oidc.replay_boundary

r[ucan_token_flow.oidc.replay_boundary]

Basalt SHALL bind an exchange to the requested Mantle audience and capability and SHALL apply the configured replay policy before issuance.

#### Scenario: One-time exchange repeats

- **GIVEN** a policy that requires one-time exchange and a replay key already committed for the same public token facts and request
- **WHEN** the caller repeats exchange
- **THEN** Basalt SHALL reject the replay
- **AND** it SHALL NOT issue another UCAN

#### Scenario: Replay storage is unavailable

- **GIVEN** a policy that requires replay prevention and an unavailable replay store
- **WHEN** exchange reaches replay admission
- **THEN** exchange SHALL fail closed

### Requirement: ucan_token_flow.oidc.redacted_evidence

r[ucan_token_flow.oidc.redacted_evidence]

Basalt SHALL record bounded exchange decisions without raw OIDC tokens, UCAN bearer tokens, private keys, provider credentials, full JWK sets, or secret-derived hashes.

#### Scenario: Exchange succeeds or fails

- **GIVEN** any terminal exchange outcome
- **WHEN** Basalt emits evidence
- **THEN** evidence MAY include policy, issuer profile, selected public subject, requested and granted capability, key identifier, and reason code
- **AND** it SHALL omit bearer and secret material
